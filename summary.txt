Implementation strategy:
    (describe how you went about implementing the assignment and how the work was divided between the partners.)
    In order to implement this, we used the strategy and order suggested by the TODOs and the
    instruction page (completing first part - ShortestPaths - before moving onto the second -
    McDiver.) For ShortestPaths we wanted to make sure that our implementation was sound before
    moving onto the next parts, so we wrote our test cases for it before starting on McDiver.
    We both contributed equally to the assignment as we both took turns being the person typing
    or the person that guides for every part of the assignment.

Testing strategy:
    (how did you perform testing and design test cases to achieve coverage?)
    We tested our implementation of ShortestPaths before moving onto McDiver. We first designed our
    test cases based on black-box testing where we wrote test cases based on the specification
    of our method. Then, after success with that, we wrote glass-box test cases where we made sure
    that the implementation was checked (every branch of the implementation has been visited).

Known problems:
    (are there any things that do not work?)
    We struggled a bit on the optimization portion of the assignment. Having a working version
    wasn't as challenging. The parts that didn't work for us (parts that we couldn't find
    a working implementation) was when we tried to find a minimum distance from the ring (in
    seek phase) everytime we checked a neighbor. Sometimes, McDiver goes in cycles. We had to
    completely rethink our implementation.

Comments on the assignment: It really helped understand the basics of Dijkstra's algorithm, and
    we are now much more comfortable with graph traversals.
